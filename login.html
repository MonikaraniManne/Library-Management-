                <p> Library management is a sub-discipline of institutional management that focuses on specific issues faced by libraries and library management professionals. Library management encompasses normal managerial tasks, as well as intellectual freedom and fundraising responsibilities. Issues faced in library management frequently overlap with those faced in managing non-profit organizations.[1]
                The basic functions of library management include overseeing all library operations, managing the library budget, planning and negotiating the acquisition of materials, Interlibrary Loan [ILL] requests, stacks maintenance, over seeing fee collection, event planning, fundraising, and human resources

                <h3>Planning and maintaining library facilities</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>An important aspect of library management is planning and maintaining library facilities. Successful planning is defined as "active planning that ensures an organization will have the right people in the right place at the right time for right job" [4] Planning the construction of new libraries or remodeling those that exist is integral since user needs are often changing. To supplement their operating budget, managers often secure funding through donor gifts and fundraising. Many facilities have begun including cafes, Friends of the Library spaces, and even exhibits[5] to help generate additional revenue.[6] These areas should be taken into account when planning for building expansions.

                <hr>
                <p>
                    As the ERMS transitions into the next-generation library management system, the records issues will have to be resolved. The knowledge base has been shown to be effective in the electronic resource world, and the dream would be to have the same for all formats. How well the developers can achieve this certainly remains to be seen, but if there can be a system that holistically represents the library’s collections and associated licensing and usage data, it will greatly facilitate resource sharing and allow new kinds of collection development and acquisition to evolve. E-books, because they are sold as front-list, package, patron-driven and title-by-title option
